# Resources and Publications

This document contains a collection of links on the topic of Blockchain and Ethereum, to complement the workshop.

I've separated this list into selection of recommended introductory articles, followed by the full list of references to learn more about a particular topic. I'll also include any miscellaneous interesting links at the end.

## Recommended Pre-Reading

The following articles are recommended as a means of acquiring background context to the workshop and should be understandable without any prior knowledge.

1. [How Will Bitcoin 2.0 Change the World?](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/041315/how-will-bitcoin-20-change-world.asp) - introduction to the topic
2. [A gentle Introduction to Blockchain Technology](https://bitsonblocks.net/2015/09/09/a-gentle-introduction-to-blockchain-technology/) - a technical primer
3. [Cut and dry: Building a dream](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/) - a quick history of Ethereum

If you'd like to see what's going on in the world Ethereum dapps, check out [state of the dapps](http://dapps.ethercasts.com/). Hopefully by the end of this workshop you'll be able to add your own dapps to the list!
