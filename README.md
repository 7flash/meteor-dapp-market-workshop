# Dapp Workshop

The Dapp we build will be a simple decentralised marketplace. This gives anyone the ability to create a marketplace registry (a list of items) and list any item for sale, which can then be purchased by anyone and is facilitated using an [escrow contract](https://github.com/frozeman/example-escrow-dapp). It's also censorship-resistant meaning there are no single points of centralisation as everything is managed by decentralised networks (Ethereum + IPFS).
